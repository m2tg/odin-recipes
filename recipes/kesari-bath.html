    <p>Rava kesari or kesari bath is one of the most commonly cherished desserts in south India. “Kesari” means orange color, and hence this sweet dish made from rava, which has rich orange golden color in its appearance gets its name. Rava kesari is very prominent sweet dish in the states of Tamilnadu, Karnataka and Andhrapradesh. It’s impossible to miss a rava kesari in “mini tiffin” from Saravana bhavan or A2B. Similarly, you walk to any darshini or sagar eateries in Karnataka; it is a common sight to see the vibrant orange kesari bath in the palate. Rava kesari is closely similar to the sooji ka halwa of the north, except for the addition of saffron or kesari color in the dish. The rava kesari is also a very common Prasad or offering to the god in festivals like Navratri, Krishna Janmashtami, Bogi (The day prior to Sankranti) and many more.</p>
    <p>I have been tasting rava kesari from the earliest days of my childhood and my mother is adept in making the same. I had always thought that it’s the easiest sweet dishes to make (well!! It is an easy dish) and I decided to try the same. But as they say behind every sweet dish there are some sweet and interesting stories too which makes life memorable. My cousin was coming home for lunch; I was just married for 3 months and planned an authentic south Indian lunch menu with Rava kesari as the sweet dish. To my knowledge, I had done everything properly, but I stirred only a few times and left it to cook on its own. No points to guess, the result was a “LUMP” rava kesari. My cousin, being a perfect gentleman forced it on himself with only one request that I never make a kesari for him again. Later, as years passed by, I learnt to make the perfect kesari ever. This is my story of learning to make rava kesari. Do try this simple recipe mentioned below and you can share your story too.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Semolina (Rava / Sooji / Farina) - 1 cup</li>
        <li>Ghee/ Butter - 1/2 cup</li>
        <li>Ghee - 2 tbsp + 2 tbsp (for roasting the rava and toasting the nuts)</li>
        <li>Sugar - 1 cup (add 1/2 cup more if you like it sweeter) - For sugar free option, add any sugar free sweetner.</li>
        <li>Salt - a pinch</li>
        <li>Cashews/Almonds - 10 nos (sliced/chopped)</li>
        <li>Raisins - 10 nos</li>
        <li>Kesari colour - One pinch (You can also use red/yellow/orange food color)</li>
        <li>Water - 4 cups</li>
        <li>Cardamom - 3 pods(crushed)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat some ghee in a heavy bottomed pan, toast the nuts and raisins. Remove it and keep it aside.</li>
        <li>Add some more ghee and roast the rava until it turns golden brown. Remove it and keep it aside.</li>
        <li>In the same pan, bring the water to a boil. Add the salt, sugar and kesari color.</li>
        <li>Slowly add the rava while constantly stirring it. Reduce the heat and let it cook covered for 5 minutes. The rava will absorb all the liquid and become soft.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining ghee, crushed cardamom pods and the toasted nuts. Mix everything together and cook for couple of minutes.</li>
        <li>You will see the halwa (kesari) moving like a big mass. Switch off when it is still a little loose. The kesari will thicken as it sits. Serve warm!!</li>
